      <h3 id="about">About</h3>
      <p>
        The entirely open source and free browser extension "Historia Quick Launcher" (short: "Historia") functions as a meta link collector and searcher for websites all over the world.
        <br><br>
        It has the following features and advantages:
      </p>
      <div class="card about-card">
        <p class="about-p"><i class="bi bi-bookmark-fill"> For many browsers: </i> For Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge and Chrome based browsers + online version for all users.<br>
          <i class="bi bi-bookmark-fill"> Many entries:</i> Currently around 610 links with descriptions integrated.<br>
          <i class="bi bi-bookmark-fill"> Many languages:</i> The collected websites are in the following languages: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, Hungarian, Dutch, Finnish, Japanese, simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese, Korean, Russian, Hebrew.<br>
          <i class="bi bi-bookmark-fill"> Time span:</i> Antiquity (and before) - (mainly Early) Modern Period<br>
          <i class="bi bi-bookmark-fill"> Always up to date: </i> The links are tested from time to time to avoid dead links.<br>
          <i class="bi bi-bookmark-fill"> Multi-purpose: </i> For students, lecturers and amateurs to find already known or new websites.<br>
          <i class="bi bi-bookmark-fill"> Sustainable: </i> Entirely open-source and for everyone to participate, without deadlines.<br>
          <i class="bi bi-bookmark-fill"> Easy to manipulate: </i> The extension is written in / with: HTML, Javascript, jQuery 3.6.2, jQuery dataTables 1.13.1, CSS, JSON, manifest 2V for Firefox, manifest 3V for Microsoft Edge, Opera and Chrome.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        DISCLAIMER: Please note that the extension, developer and contributors are not responsible for the content of the links. The extension "Historia" is a voluntarily work to help researchers all around the world. The descirption texts are written based on the "About" page of every website.
      </p>
      <br>

      <div class="card about-card">
        <p class="subtitle"> Philosophy </p>
        <p>The world of researchers is expanding from the printed world into the digital world with vast possibilities to represent and manipulate text and data in general. However, keeping track of all those digital resources we have on hand is becoming a task in itself. During study and research, everyone starts to list them up at some point and we all are ending up with similar lists on our own that we must import and export in case of major technical changes (changing browsers, changing the distro, changing the computer etc.). Some new students are still receiving lists of important links printed on paper. Researchers who are willing to expand their research fields still need to ask others for digital resources that are not necessarily included in printed books. </p>
        <p class="important-text">What if we could just make one single list for everyone around the world?</p>
        <p>Indeed, there are some similar predecessors of this project such as <a href="http://mdr-maa.org/" target="_blank">"Medieval Digital Resources (MDR)"</a>, <a href="http://www.menestrel.fr/-Sources-et-ressources-" target="_blank">"MÃ©nestrel"</a> and <a href="https://www.saveancientstudies.org/ancient-studies-resources" target="_blank">"Save Ancient Studies Alliance (SASA)"</a> as well as many websites and blogs with endless lists of useful websites. As it is always the case when building up a project, it is thanks to those already existing works that other projects can be build upon. However, from the point of view of the developer of Historia, it must be said that they all have problems that need to be faced:</p>

        <p class="about-p">
          <i class="bi bi-1-square-fill"> Problem: </i> The websites require the user to go to their websites to search for what they need. This is sufficient in order to find new resources, but as we all want to save time by human nature, many of us end up preferring using bookmarks that are directly accessible from the browser instead. <br>
          <i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"> Historia's solution: </i> By making it directly accessible on browsers by creating a browser extension, it is possible to eliminate the extra step of going to a website. Behind one single icon, one can find hundreds of searchable bookmarks saved. <br> <br>
          <i class="bi bi-2-square-fill"> Problem: </i> Depending on the project, as long as a project has a funding time span, there will always be an end to the project. After the project's end, in many cases nobody is responsible for keeping the list up to date. Thus, after a certain time, the list will have a certain amount of dead links and is lacking of recent projects. <br>
          <i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"> Historia's solution: </i> By making it open source, even if the developer is not able to continue updating the project due to life circumstances, basically everyone with a bit of programming knowledge can continue keeping the list alive. <br> <br>
          <i class="bi bi-3-square-fill"> Problem: </i> A project that is tied to specific people, institutions or fundings can be tied to a specific server as well. A server however requires maintanance, the domain name must be paid annually - thus there are costs, which leads to the need of fundings. <br>
          <i class="bi bi-check-square-fill"> Historia's solution: </i> By making Historia an extension based on JavaScript queries (and not based on a SQL/noSQL database) and hosting the online version as well as the project page on GitHub, costs can be saved. This is the reason why Historia's core will never be a WebApp (a searchable server-based database), but a simple HTML table animated with JavaScript. The future task on the developer's side will be efficient coding in order to reduce loading time.</p>
